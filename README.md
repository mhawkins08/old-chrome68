# INFO

This is the official repository for old-chrome68. This is currently only avaliable on Windows 10!
Please only use this browser on Windows 10 21H2 as not doing so can impose security risk. 

Using newer versions of Chrome, I have developed a version that has the old-ui from Chrome 68 but with the current security patches from Chrome 105. This is based on CHROMIUM-68.

You can log into all of your accounts safely. Please, when using this browser; get an extension that forces https on websites or make sure that you are visiting HTTPS websites as not doing so on this browser could lead to many security risk.
