# old-chrome68
This is the official repository for old-chrome68. This is currently only avaliable on Windows 10!
Please only use this browser on Windows 10 21H2 as not doing so can impose security risk. 

Using newer versions of Chrome, I have developed a version that has the old-ui from Chrome 68 but with the current security patches from Chrome 105. 
This is the only old-chrome version ever created in History. Please remember, even with the security patches. Not being safe when browsing the web can lead
to many problems. Stay safe on the internet. 

You can log into all of your accounts safely. Please, when using this browser; get an extension that forces https on websites or make sure that you are visiting HTTPS
websites as not doing so on this browser could lead to many security risk.
